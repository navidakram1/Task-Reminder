# 🔧 Lottie Animation Fix - Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** iOS bundling failed with error:
```
Unable to resolve "@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react-native" from "app\(onboarding)\screen-2-chaos.tsx"
```

**Root Cause:** The `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react-native` package had dependency conflicts with `lottie-react-native`.

**Solution:** Replaced all DotLottie imports with standard `lottie-react-native` package.
