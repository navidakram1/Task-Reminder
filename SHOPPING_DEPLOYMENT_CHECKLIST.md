## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/HomeTaskReminder

# Push database schema to Supabase
supabase db push

# Verify migration was successful
supabase db list
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] `shopping_lists` table created
- [ ] `shopping_items` table created
- [ ] Indexes created
- [ ] RLS policies enabled

### Step 2: Test on Mobile (iOS)
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Select iOS
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app

# Test the following:
- [ ] Navigate to shopping system
- [ ] Create a shopping list
- [ ] Add items to list
- [ ] Mark items as complete
- [ ] Delete items
- [ ] Delete list
- [ ] View progress bar
- [ ] Test animations
- [ ] Test error handling
```

### Step 3: Test on Mobile (Android)
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Select Android
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app

# Test the following:
- [ ] Navigate to shopping system
- [ ] Create a shopping list
- [ ] Add items to list
- [ ] Mark items as complete
- [ ] Delete items
- [ ] Delete list
- [ ] View progress bar
- [ ] Test animations
- [ ] Test error handling
```

### Step 4: Test on Web
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Select Web
# Browser opens automatically

# Test the following:
- [ ] Navigate to shopping system
- [ ] Create a shopping list
- [ ] Add items to list
- [ ] Mark items as complete
- [ ] Delete items
- [ ] Delete list
- [ ] View progress bar
- [ ] Test animations
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test responsive design
```

### Step 5: Multi-User Testing
```bash
# Open app on two different devices/browsers

# Test the following:
- [ ] User A creates a list
- [ ] User B sees the list
- [ ] User A adds items
- [ ] User B sees items in real-time
- [ ] User B marks item complete
- [ ] User A sees completion status
- [ ] User A deletes item
- [ ] User B sees deletion
```

### Step 6: Security Testing
```bash
# Test RLS policies

# Verify the following:
- [ ] User can only see their household's lists
- [ ] User cannot access other household's lists
- [ ] User can only modify their household's items
- [ ] Admin can delete lists
- [ ] Non-admin cannot delete lists
- [ ] Permissions are enforced at database level
```

### Step 7: Performance Testing
```bash
# Test with large datasets

# Verify the following:
- [ ] App loads quickly with 100+ lists
- [ ] Lists load quickly with 100+ items
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps)
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Indexes are working
```

### Step 8: Error Handling Testing
```bash
# Test error scenarios

# Verify the following:
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Invalid input handling
- [ ] Permission error handling
- [ ] Database error handling
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] User can retry actions
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Check user feedback
- [ ] Monitor crash reports
- [ ] Check analytics

### User Feedback
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Monitor support tickets
- [ ] Track feature usage
- [ ] Identify pain points
- [ ] Plan improvements

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Page load time
- [ ] API response time

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found:

### Step 1: Identify Issue
- [ ] Determine root cause
- [ ] Assess impact
- [ ] Prioritize fix

### Step 2: Rollback Database (if needed)
```bash
# Revert migration
supabase db reset

# Or manually drop tables
supabase db query "DROP TABLE shopping_items CASCADE;"
supabase db query "DROP TABLE shopping_lists CASCADE;"
```

### Step 3: Rollback Code (if needed)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or remove shopping files
rm -rf app/(app)/shopping/
```

### Step 4: Redeploy
```bash
# After fixes are made
npm start
```
