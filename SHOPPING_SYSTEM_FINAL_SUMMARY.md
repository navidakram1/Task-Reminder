## 🗄️ Database Schema

### shopping_lists Table
```
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- household_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- name (TEXT, Required)
- description (TEXT, Optional)
- created_by (UUID, Foreign Key)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**shopping_lists**
- SELECT: Users can view lists in their household
- INSERT: Users can create lists in their household
- UPDATE: Users can update lists in their household
- DELETE: Only list creator or household admin can delete

**shopping_items**
- SELECT: Users can view items in their household's lists
- INSERT: Users can add items to their household's lists
- UPDATE: Users can update items in their household's lists
- DELETE: Users can delete items from their household's lists

### Data Isolation
- Lists are household-specific
- Items are list-specific
- No cross-household data leakage
- User permissions enforced at database level
