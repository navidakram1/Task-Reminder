### 4. ✅ Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/task_comments_and_reviews.sql`)

**New Table: `task_comments`**
- Stores comments on tasks
- Links to household and user
- Timestamps for created_at and updated_at
- RLS policies for household-based access

**Enhanced `tasks` Table:**
- Updated status constraint: `pending`, `in_progress`, `pending_review`, `completed`, `cancelled`
- New columns:
  - `reviewed_by` (UUID) - Who reviewed the task
  - `reviewed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When it was reviewed
  - `review_notes` (TEXT) - Review feedback
  - `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When task was completed

**PostgreSQL Functions:**
1. **`mark_task_done(p_task_id UUID)`**
   - Sets status to `pending_review`
   - Sets `completed_at` timestamp
   - Returns success/error

2. **`approve_task_review(p_task_id, p_reviewer_id, p_review_notes)`**
   - Sets status to `completed`
   - Records reviewer and review notes
   - Sets `reviewed_at` timestamp
   - Returns success/error

3. **`request_task_changes(p_task_id, p_reviewer_id, p_review_notes)`**
   - Sets status back to `in_progress`
   - Records reviewer and review notes
   - Sets `reviewed_at` timestamp
   - Clears `completed_at`
   - Returns success/error

**Views:**
- `tasks_pending_review` - Easy query for pending reviews
- `task_comments_with_users` - Comments with user info

**Indexes:**
- Performance optimization on `task_comments` table

**RLS Policies:**
- Household-based access control
- Users can only see/add comments in their households
