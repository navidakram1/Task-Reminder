# üö® URGENT FIX GUIDE - Task Marking Error

## ‚ùå Error You're Seeing:

```
ERROR  Error marking task complete: {
  "code": "42703", 
  "details": null, 
  "hint": null, 
  "message": "record \"new\" has no field \"effort_score\""
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ QUICK FIX (2 Steps)

### **Step 1: Fix Database Trigger** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED!**

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `FIX_EFFORT_SCORE_ERROR.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Wait for "Success" message

**What this does:**
- Fixes the database trigger that's looking for a non-existent `effort_score` field
- Updates the trigger to use a default value of 1 instead

---

### **Step 2: Reload Your App**

```bash
# Press 'r' in Expo terminal
r
```

---

## üéØ What Was Wrong?

The database has a trigger (`update_workload_on_task_completion`) that runs whenever a task status changes. This trigger was trying to access a field called `effort_score` that doesn't exist in your tasks table.

**The trigger is in:** `database/workload_functions.sql`

**The error happens when:**
- You mark a task as done
- The trigger fires
- It tries to read `NEW.effort_score`
- Field doesn't exist ‚Üí ERROR!

---

## üìã Complete Fix Steps

### **1. Run the SQL Fix**

Open `FIX_EFFORT_SCORE_ERROR.sql` and run it in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This recreates the trigger function without effort_score
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_workload_on_task_completion()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'completed' AND OLD.status != 'completed' THEN
    PERFORM complete_task_workload(
      NEW.household_id,
      NEW.assignee_id,
      1  -- Default effort score
    );
  END IF;
  
  IF NEW.assignee_id IS NOT NULL AND OLD.assignee_id IS NULL THEN
    PERFORM increment_member_workload(
      NEW.household_id,
      NEW.assignee_id,
      1  -- Default effort score
    );
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Recreate the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS task_workload_trigger ON tasks;
CREATE TRIGGER task_workload_trigger
  AFTER UPDATE ON tasks
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_workload_on_task_completion();
```

- Comments on tasks
- Task review system
- Approval workflow

#### **B. Storage Bucket Setup**

Run `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql` to enable:
- Completion proof image uploads
- Storage policies

---

### **3. Reload App**

```bash
# In Expo terminal, press:
r
```

---

   - Title with emoji
   - Status badge
   - Description
   - Assigned to (with avatar)
   - Created by (with avatar)

   - Priority
   - Recurrence
3. **Expected:** No errors in console

---

## üêõ If Still Having Issues:

### **Error: "Function mark_task_done does not exist"**

**Fix:** Run `supabase/migrations/task_comments_and_reviews.sql`

This creates the `mark_task_done()` function.

---

### **Error: "Storage bucket task-proofs does not exist"**

**Fix:** 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click "New Bucket"
3. Name: `task-proofs`
4. Public: ‚úÖ YES
5. Click "Create"
6. Run `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`

---

### **Error: "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined"**

**Fix:** This is already fixed in the updated `[id].tsx` file.

The file now properly fetches user data with:
```typescript
assignee:assignee_id (
  id,
  name,
  email,
  photo_url
)
```

---

### **Comments Not Showing**

**Fix:** Run the migration:
```sql
-- From task_comments_and_reviews.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task_comments (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  household_id UUID REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  comment TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
