# 🔧 Clear Cache and Fix LottieView Error

## The Issue
The app is showing a `LottieView` error even though we've removed all LottieView references. This is likely due to Metro cache.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Clear Metro Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### 2. If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
npx expo r -c
```

### 3. Nuclear option (if still having issues):
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .expo
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

### 4. Alternative commands:
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
npx expo install --fix

# Clear React Native cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## What Should Work Now

✅ **App with emoji icons** - No LottieView dependencies  
✅ **All 6 tabs working** - Home, Tasks, Bills, Review, Proposals, Settings  
✅ **Clean navigation** - No animation errors  
✅ **Dashboard functionality** - All features working  

## Current Status

- ❌ **LottieView removed** from all files
- ❌ **Package removed** from package.json  
- ❌ **Styles cleaned up** - No lottie references
- ✅ **Emoji fallback** working
- ✅ **All functionality** preserved

## After Cache Clear

The app should run without any LottieView errors. You'll have:
- 🏠 Home tab with emoji icon
- ✅ Tasks tab with emoji icon  
- 💰 Bills tab with emoji icon
- ⭐ Review tab with emoji icon
- 📋 Proposals tab with emoji icon
- ⚙️ Settings tab with emoji icon

## To Re-enable Lottie Later

1. Add package back: `npm install lottie-react-native@7.2.2`
2. Follow the INSTALL_LOTTIE.md guide
3. Uncomment the import and update the component

## Troubleshooting

If you still see LottieView errors:
1. Check if any other files import LottieView
2. Restart your development server completely
3. Clear all caches as shown above
4. Check if there are any TypeScript compilation errors
