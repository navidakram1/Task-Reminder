## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
app/(onboarding)/
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx          # Navigation layout
â”œâ”€â”€ intro.tsx           # Welcome/intro screen
â”œâ”€â”€ features.tsx        # Feature showcase
â”œâ”€â”€ permissions.tsx     # Permission requests
â””â”€â”€ welcome.tsx         # Final welcome screen

components/
â”œâ”€â”€ SwipeableOnboarding.tsx    # Swipe gesture handling
â””â”€â”€ AccessibleOnboarding.tsx   # Accessibility helpers

utils/
â””â”€â”€ onboarding.ts       # State management utilities

__tests__/
â””â”€â”€ onboarding.test.tsx # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Key Components

#### SwipeableOnboarding
- Handles swipe gestures between screens
- Provides smooth transitions
- Includes progress indicators
- Supports swipe hints

#### AccessibleOnboarding
- Manages accessibility features
- Handles screen reader announcements
- Provides accessible form fields
- Respects user preferences

#### OnboardingUtils
- Manages onboarding state persistence
- Tracks completion status
- Handles permission storage
- Provides analytics hooks

### State Management

The onboarding flow uses AsyncStorage to persist:
- Completion status (`onboarding_complete`)
- Current step (`onboarding_current_step`)
- Granted permissions (`permissions_granted`)

### Navigation Flow

```
Index â†’ Check onboarding status
â”œâ”€â”€ New User â†’ /(onboarding)/intro
â”œâ”€â”€ Returning User â†’ /(auth)/landing
â””â”€â”€ Authenticated â†’ /(app)/dashboard

Onboarding Flow:
intro â†’ features â†’ permissions â†’ welcome â†’ create-join-household
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- **Component Rendering**: All screens render correctly
- **Navigation**: Proper routing between screens
- **Interactions**: Button presses and gestures
- **Permissions**: Permission request handling
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard support
- **Performance**: Animation smoothness
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS, Android, and Web compatibility

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all onboarding tests
npm test onboarding.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage onboarding.test.tsx

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch onboarding.test.tsx
```

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Profile setup completes successfully with validation and photo upload
- [ ] Household creation/joining works with proper error handling
- [ ] Back navigation works correctly between steps
- [ ] Animations are smooth and maintain 60fps performance
- [ ] Loading states are shown during async operations
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully with retry options
- [ ] Accessibility features work properly (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)

## Customization

### Modifying Content

To update onboarding content:

1. **Text Content**: Edit the screen files directly
2. **Images/Icons**: Update the emoji or add image components
3. **Colors**: Modify the gradient colors in each screen
4. **Animation Timing**: Adjust duration values in animation configs

### Adding New Steps

1. Add new screen file in `app/(onboarding)/`
2. Update `_layout.tsx` to include the new screen
3. Update `ONBOARDING_STEPS` in `utils/onboarding.ts`
4. Add tests for the new screen

### Customizing Animations

All animations respect the user's reduced motion preference. To modify:

1. **Duration**: Change animation duration values
2. **Easing**: Update easing functions
3. **Effects**: Add new animated properties
4. **Performance**: Use `useNativeDriver: true` for better performance

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Native Driver**: All animations use native driver when possible
2. **Lazy Loading**: Screens are loaded on demand
3. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animations and listeners
4. **Image Optimization**: Use optimized images and icons
5. **Bundle Size**: Minimal dependencies for onboarding

### Performance Monitoring

- Monitor frame rates during animations
- Track memory usage during transitions
- Measure time to interactive for each screen
- Test on low-end devices

## Accessibility Guidelines

### WCAG Compliance

The onboarding flow follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:

- **Perceivable**: High contrast, scalable text, alternative text
- **Operable**: Keyboard navigation, gesture alternatives
- **Understandable**: Clear language, consistent navigation
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies

### Testing Accessibility

1. **Screen Readers**: Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are reachable
3. **Color Contrast**: Verify sufficient contrast ratios
4. **Motion**: Test with reduced motion enabled
5. **Font Scaling**: Test with large font sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Animations Not Working**: Check if reduced motion is enabled
2. **Navigation Issues**: Verify route names match file structure
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper permission handling
4. **State Persistence**: Check AsyncStorage implementation
5. **Performance Issues**: Profile animations and optimize

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```typescript
const DEBUG_ONBOARDING = __DEV__ && true
```

This will log:
- Navigation events
- Animation states
- Permission requests
- State changes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Personalization**: Customize onboarding based on user type
2. **A/B Testing**: Test different onboarding flows
3. **Analytics**: Detailed tracking of user behavior
4. **Localization**: Multi-language support
5. **Video Tutorials**: Embedded video demonstrations

### Performance Improvements

1. **Preloading**: Preload next screen content
2. **Caching**: Cache animation assets
3. **Optimization**: Further reduce bundle size
4. **Native Modules**: Use native implementations for complex animations
