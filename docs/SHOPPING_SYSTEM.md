  .from('shopping_lists')
  .select('*')
  .eq('household_id', householdId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

### Add Shopping Item
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('shopping_items')
  .insert([{
    list_id: id,
    name: itemName,
    quantity: itemQuantity,
    completed: false,
  }])
  .select()
```

### Toggle Item Completion
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('shopping_items')
  .update({ completed: !completed })
  .eq('id', itemId)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Item Categories**: Better organization with predefined categories
2. **Sharing**: Share lists with specific people outside household
3. **Templates**: Save and reuse common shopping lists
4. **Price Tracking**: Add prices and calculate total cost
5. **Barcode Scanning**: Scan items to add to list
6. **Notifications**: Remind members about incomplete lists
7. **History**: Track past shopping lists and items
8. **Favorites**: Quick-add frequently purchased items

## Troubleshooting

### Lists Not Loading
- Check household membership
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check network connection

### Items Not Saving
- Ensure list ID is valid
- Check user has write permissions
- Verify item name is not empty

### Completion Status Not Updating
- Refresh the list
- Check for network issues
- Verify RLS policies allow updates

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexes**: Created on household_id, created_by, list_id, and completed
- **Pagination**: Consider adding for large lists (100+ items)
- **Caching**: Items are fetched fresh on each view
- **Real-time**: Consider adding Supabase subscriptions for live updates
