## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

### **Step 1: Reload Your Expo App** (30 seconds)

Your Expo app is still running with the old schema cache. You need to reload it:

**Option A: Press 'r' in the Expo terminal**
```
Press r in the terminal where Expo is running
```

**Option B: Restart Expo completely**
```bash
# Stop current Expo (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart with clear cache
npx expo start --clear
```

### **Step 2: Test Creating a Task** (1 minute)

1. Open your app
2. Navigate to **Tasks** → **Create Task**
3. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test Task"
   - Select a priority (low/medium/high/urgent)
   - Add an emoji (optional)
   - Select an assignee
4. Click **Save**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ "Task created successfully" message
- ✅ Task appears in task list

DEFAULT 'medium';

-- 2. Added emoji column
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS emoji TEXT;

-- 3. Fixed foreign key
ALTER TABLE household_members 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS household_members_user_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE household_members 
ADD CONSTRAINT household_members_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 4. Reloaded schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### Additional Actions:
- Paused Supabase project
- Restored Supabase project
- This forced a complete schema cache reload

4. Test recurring tasks

### **Long-term (Optional):**
1. Add animations to settings
2. Connect real features to Beautiful Settings
3. Improve error handling UI
4. Add accessibility features

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Still getting errors after reloading**

**Solution 1: Hard restart Expo**
```bash
# Stop Expo (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start --clear --reset-cache
```

**Solution 2: Check Supabase connection**
```bash
# Verify your .env file has correct Supabase URL and key
cat .env
```

**Solution 3: Verify database**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'tasks' 
AND column_name IN ('priority', 'emoji');
```
Should return 2 rows.

### **Issue: Members not loading**

This is expected if you don't have any household members yet. The fallback query will handle this gracefully.

To add members:
1. Invite users to your household
2. They need to sign up
3. Their profiles will be created automatically
