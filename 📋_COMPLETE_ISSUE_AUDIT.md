## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: RLS Disabled on All Tables
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Impact**: Users couldn't create tasks, bills, or shopping lists

**Details**:
- RLS was disabled on 10 core tables
- No security policies were enforced
- Anyone could theoretically access any data
- App showed "not part of household" error

**Fix Applied**:
- Enabled RLS on all 10 tables
- Created 30+ security policies
- Verified policies are working

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('tasks', 'bills', 'household_members');
-- Result: All show rowsecurity = true ✅
```

### Issue #2: Missing RLS Policies
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Impact**: No access control even with RLS enabled

**Details**:
- No SELECT policies
- No INSERT policies
- No UPDATE policies
- No DELETE policies
- Tables had RLS enabled but no policies

**Fix Applied**:
- Created SELECT policies for all tables
- Created INSERT policies for all tables
- Created UPDATE policies for all tables
- Created DELETE policies for all tables

**Policies Created**:
- Tasks: 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Bills: 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Bill Splits: 3 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Household Members: 2 policies (SELECT, ALL)
- Households: 2 policies (SELECT, UPDATE)
- Profiles: 2 policies (SELECT, UPDATE)
- Task Approvals: 3 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Shopping Lists: 2 policies (SELECT, INSERT)
- Shopping Items: 2 policies (SELECT, INSERT)
- Subscriptions: 2 policies (SELECT, UPDATE)

### Issue #3: Column Name Mismatch
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Impact**: RLS policies would fail with column not found error

**Details**:
- Code referenced `assignee_id` column
- Actual column name is `assigned_to`
- Would cause policy creation to fail

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated RLS policies to use `assigned_to`
- Verified column names in schema
- Tested policy creation

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'tasks';
-- Result: assigned_to column exists ✅
```

## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES

### Issue #4: Code References Wrong Column Names
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Status**: ⏳ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Impact**: App code might fail when accessing tasks

**Details**:
- App code uses `assignee_id` in multiple places
- Database column is `assigned_to`
- Will cause runtime errors

**Files Affected**:
- `app/(app)/tasks/create.tsx` - Line 212
- `app/(app)/tasks/random-assignment.tsx` - Line 63
- Other task-related files

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Search for all `assignee_id` references
- [ ] Replace with `assigned_to`
- [ ] Test task creation
- [ ] Test task assignment

---

## 🟢 MINOR ISSUES

### Issue #5: Potential Performance Issues
**Severity**: 🟢 LOW  
**Status**: ⏳ MONITOR  
**Impact**: Slow queries with large datasets

**Details**:
- RLS policies use subqueries
- Could be slow with many households
- May need optimization later

**Recommendation**:
- Monitor performance
- Add indexes if needed
- Optimize queries if slow
