## 📊 STATISTICS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tables Fixed | 10 |
| RLS Enabled | 10 |
| Policies Created | 30+ |
| Issues Fixed | 3 |
| Severity | CRITICAL |
| Status | ✅ FIXED |

## 💡 WHY THIS HAPPENED

RLS policies are essential for:
1. **Security** - Prevent unauthorized data access
2. **Data Isolation** - Keep household data separate
3. **User Verification** - Ensure users are part of household
4. **Compliance** - Meet security standards

Without RLS, the app was allowing anyone to access any data (if they knew the IDs).
