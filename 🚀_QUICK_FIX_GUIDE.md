## ⚡ QUICK START (3 STEPS)

### Step 1: Run SQL in Supabase (30 seconds) 🗄️

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **juktwo2002@gmail.com's Project**
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire content from: `supabase/SIMPLE_FIX.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. Wait for success message: "Success. No rows returned"

**The SQL adds:**
- ✅ `priority` column to tasks table
- ✅ `emoji` column to tasks table
- ✅ Fixes foreign key relationship

**Expected Output:**
```
Success. No rows returned
```

### Step 2: Restart Expo App (1 minute) 📱

In your terminal:
```bash
# Stop the current Expo server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

Or simply:
```bash
# Press 'r' in the Expo terminal to reload
r
```

---

### Step 3: Test the App (2 minutes) ✅

1. Open the app on your device/emulator
2. Navigate to **Tasks** → **Create Task**
3. Fill in task details
4. Select a household member
5. Click **Save**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Task created successfully
- ✅ Members load correctly
- ✅ Clean console output

## 📊 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing all 3 steps, verify:

- [ ] SQL migration ran successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Expo app restarted with `--clear` flag
- [ ] No errors in console when opening app
- [ ] Can navigate to Create Task screen
- [ ] Household members load in dropdown
- [ ] Can create a task with priority
- [ ] Can add emoji to task
- [ ] No routing warnings
- [ ] Task appears in task list

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: SQL migration fails
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're in the correct Supabase project
- Check if you have admin permissions
- Try running each section separately

### Issue: Still getting errors after restart
**Solution**:
```bash
# Complete cache clear
npx expo start --clear --reset-cache

# Or delete cache manually
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Issue: Members still not loading
**Solution**:
1. Check Supabase logs (Dashboard → Logs)
2. Verify foreign key was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT constraint_name 
   FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
   WHERE table_name = 'household_members';
   ```
3. Ensure profiles table has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles LIMIT 5;
   ```
